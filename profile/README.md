## Overview

Hyperlink London is a student-led organization based at Queen Mary University of London, dedicated to pioneering the future of transportation through the development of Hyperloop technology. Our multidisciplinary team comprises over 70 talented individuals from various academic backgrounds and universities across London, all united by a shared vision to revolutionize high-speed travel.

## Mission

Our mission is to accelerate the implementation of Hyperloop systems in Europe by designing and constructing operational prototypes and conducting comprehensive research on their scalability and integration into existing infrastructures.

## Current Projects

### Hyperloop Pod Prototype

We are in the process of building London's first fully operational Hyperloop pod. This project focuses on creating a financially viable prototype that demonstrates the potential for future scalability and real-world application.

### Social Sustainability

Our team is developing strategies to ensure that Hyperloop technology integrates seamlessly with local communities, existing infrastructure, and the environment. We aim to maximize utility while minimizing environmental impact, fostering sustainable urban development.

### Safety and Comfort

We are addressing critical aspects of passenger safety and comfort by researching and developing:

- **Magnetic Shielding**: Designing protective measures against electromagnetic fields generated during Hyperloop travel.
- **Ergonomic Seating**: Creating inclusive and comfortable seating arrangements that ensure passenger safety during various operational scenarios, including emergency braking.

## Achievements

Since our inception in 2020, Hyperlink London has garnered several accolades, including:

- **2023-2024**: 1st Place Award for the Braking Subsystem at Hyperloop Global.
- **2022-2023**: Sustainability and Innovation Society Award from Queen Mary University of London and the Innovation Award from Bright Network.
- **2021-2022**: 1st Place Award for the Low Power Electronics Subsystem and 2nd Place Award for the Propulsion Subsystem at the Canadian Hyperloop Conference.

## Departments

Our organization is structured into several key departments:
